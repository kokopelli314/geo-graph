Thanks to Brad Miller and David Ranum for their lovely book [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html). The priority queue code here is by them, and the rest of the algorithm and data structure code is at least heavily influenced.
